# The Grafted Bible

This isn't so much a translation as it is a hodgepodge of various translations and resources that expand upon the original intent of the writers. 
I started with the Tree of Life Version, then cross-referenced it with the NLT, the NASB, the original language, and some work from the Bible Project.

This is an ongoing personal project. It's not really meant for public use but if anyone can benefit from it, all the better.
