            <h2>What is Tome of Heroes?</h2>
            <p>ToH is a trading card game, habit-building tool, and tabletop RPG all wrapped up into one. You can grab a base deck and play against others, then level up and unlock more cards and skills by completing daily habits and goals. </p>
            <p>Most modern games prey on our natural dopaminergic reward system, stealing away our time, money, and attention. We decided to fight fire with fire, weaponizing their own tricks against them to create an addictive system of self-improvement. Instead of becoming enslaved to the digital traps of this world, we can use these same methodologies to master them.</p>
